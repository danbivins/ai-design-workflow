# AI-Assisted Design → Code Workflow (with Accessibility Guardrails)

This repository is a **learning and experimentation space** for a simple, end-to-end workflow:

**Jira → Figma → Code → Accessibility Checks**

The goal is not speed or scale — it’s **clarity, correctness, and repeatability**.

---

## What This Project Is

- A small, testable workflow for generating UI code from design intent
- A way to explore how AI can assist (not replace) design and accessibility decisions
- A controlled environment to learn where automation works — and where human judgment is required

---

## Core Principles

- Semantic HTML firs
